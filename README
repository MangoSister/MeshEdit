I performed downsampling on maxplanck.dae two times and used the vertex dragging
tool to get him a fancy haircut!


Other comments:
1. I noticed that the isBoundary() of Edge seemed to be incorrect. The original
function was written as
bool Edge::isBoundary( void )
{
  return halfedge()->face()->isBoundary();
}

However it only tested one side of the edge, ignoring the other side. Thus I
modified the function to:
bool Edge::isBoundary( void )
{
  return halfedge()->face()->isBoundary() ||
         halfedge()->twin()->face()->isBoundary();
}

so that it now handles both sides.
